# News Bot: A Slack Plugin

News Bot is a Slack app that automatically sends a Slack message containing links to the top news headlines for the day according to CNN. The message is sent out every morning at 9 am to the workspace's General channel. This is achieved by setting up a [Cron Job](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) that ensures data is fetched from CNN's API, parsed accordingly, and sent to Slack every 24 hours.
